# XPRS

eXplainable PRS (XPRS) is a software designed to enhance the interpretability of PRS by decomposing them into gene/region and SNP contribution scores. 
By utilizing Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), XPRS calculates the attributed value of each gene or region, providing detailed insights into which genes significantly contribute to an individualâ€™s PRS.
