# XPRS

eXplainable PRS (XPRS) is a software designed to enhance the interpretability of PRS by decomposing them into gene/region and SNP contribution scores. 
By utilizing Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), XPRS calculates the attributed score of each gene or region, providing detailed insights into which genes significantly contribute to an individualâ€™s PRS. 
This decomposition allows for a more granular explanation, enabling the examination of specific SNPs within genes to determine their individual impact on PRS.
